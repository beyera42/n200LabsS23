//2 - Reverse Tennis (?)

//Create two objects with properties for the x, y, width, and height for a 'tall' rectangle. Set their 'x' properties so that when drawn, one will appear on the left side of the composition, and the other on the right side.


//In the draw function,

//draw both of the rectangles in the objects to the screen, based on their properties
//if the up key is pressed, make the first object move up, and the second object move down
//if the down key is pressed, make the first object move down, and the other object move up

//if (keyIsDown(UP_ARROW)) {
    //change properties
//}
