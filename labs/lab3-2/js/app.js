//Write a function that

//takes a color as an argument ( you can use color(170, 200, 150) )
//sets the red component of that color to zero  ( colorVariableArgumentName.setRed(0) )
//Returns that new color without red
//Then, test this function by drawing a circle to the screen using the result. You might have something like:
let noRed = removeRed(color(170, 200, 150));

fill(noRed);

//draw circle
