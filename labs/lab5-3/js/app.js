/* Personal Composition

Create a composition that, at minimum:
1. Changes the css property of an asset on a mouse interaction (mouse over, mouse out, click)
2. Modifies and changes the inner html of one element
3. Accesses and modifies a variable outside of a local, function scope 

Is this a 1, 2, and 3 situation or is this a 1, 2, or 3 one? 

This might change in the future, but I want to try to replicate something close to the feel of Maya Autodesk, so I would want to have a function that changes the color of a part of the function to a color close to what we see in that program */
